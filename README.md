This is a mini game where text would be shown to the player.

The text would be the name of a colour. Ex: Red, Blue, Green

However the colour of the text may or may not be the same as the actual text. Ex Text: Red Color: Blue

The player can select the amount of time that they have and the timer will start when they press ENTER.

good luck and have fun
